Command safety classifier for Claude Code PreToolUse hooks.

Output: JSON object with keys:

# DANGER-LATCH-CALIBRATION-001 — explicit allow-list of read-only surface
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hybrid fail-closed semantics: for `git`, `gh`, and `npm` (the three
# governed command families), a subcommand NOT on the allow-list and NOT
# matched by any deny/confirm pattern resolves to "ask". Other commands
# keep the existing classifier default. The allow-list itself is
# command+subcommand specific — `gh pr view` is admitted, `gh pr merge`
# is not (it falls through to ask). See spec invariant for the full
# canonical surface.
#
# IMPORTANT: editing this allow-list weakens or expands the agent-
# boundary guard. Add a name only after confirming it is observational
# (no filesystem mutation, no network write, no privileged operation,
# no irreversible state change to GitHub / npm / git).

# Top-level simple commands that are read-only file inspection or search.
# Matched by exact basename of the segment's first executable token.
# These do NOT have subcommands worth tracking; presence of the name is
# enough.
ALLOWED_SIMPLE_COMMANDS: set[str] = {

    "tail", "head", "cat", "less", "more", "wc", "stat", "file",
    "du", "df", "ls", "tree",
    # Search
    "grep", "rg",
    # `find` is NOT in this set because of -delete/-exec/-execdir/-fprint/-ok;
    # classify_allow_list handles find specifically.
}

# Allowed git subcommands.
#
# Two classes live here:
#   - Read-only inspection: status, log, diff, show, branch, tag, remote,
#     config, rev-parse, ls-files, blame (gated to read-only forms in
#     classify_allow_list).
#   - Everyday-workflow writes that have never been a loss or attribution
#     risk: "add" and "commit". These mutate the index / create a new commit
#     object but do not rewrite history, discard working-tree state, or touch
#     a remote. Their dangerous variants ("commit" with --amend) are
#     special-cased to "ask" in classify_allow_list, and worktree-guard.sh
#     independently governs commit-on-main / inherited-dirty-state
#     coordination. Branch-creating
#     "checkout -b" / "switch -c" are admitted by their own special-cases;
#     bare "checkout <path>" / "checkout ." stay denied by
#     CONFIRM_SEGMENT_PATTERNS because they discard changes.
#
# Why widen: the prior read-only-only calibration swept plain "git add" /
# "git commit" into "unknown git subcommand -> ask", and an "ask" engages
# the sticky session latch. That trapped agents on the CAWS-documented
# happy path (commit the spec on main, then create the worktree): the
# first commit of real work latched the session and hard-blocked every
# subsequent Bash call. The latch must fire on panic/bypass patterns
# (flag-split git-bootstrap, force-push, rm -rf), not on calm everyday
# commits. The latch -- not the allow-list -- is the deep control: the
# allow-list keeps the happy path calm, the latch catches the bypass.

    # each armed the latch mid-slice while only INSPECTING state).

      enforcement — the wrapper contract block-dangerous.sh branches on:
                    pass | advisory | confirm | block.
    enforcement is DERIVED from (decision, source) by derive_enforcement(): deny
    -> block; allow -> pass; a CAPABILITY-derived ask (facet lattice / opaque-exec,
    carrying structured semantic evidence) or a classifier_error/budget ask ->
    confirm (current-command human approval at the hook boundary); every other
    ask (legacy governed-family default, CONFIRM regex, rm/find) -> advisory,
    preserving CAWS-DANGER-LATCH-CATASTROPHIC-ONLY-001. Bare `ask -> block` is
    explicitly rejected.

    `_depth` threads the shared recursion budget through every re-entry path
    (substitution, nested-shell, opaque-exec). At the budget the classifier
    returns a conservative "ask" rather than recursing further.
    `_adapters` caches the loaded sidecar across recursive calls.
