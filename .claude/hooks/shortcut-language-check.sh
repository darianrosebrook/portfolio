# CAWS Shortcut-Language Progressive Check (QG-HOOKS-EXTRACT-001)
#
# PostToolUse hook firing on Write/Edit. Flags "shortcut" / incomplete-work
# language in committed-bound source — the edit-time analogue of the
# quality-gates `todo_detection` gate
# (packages/quality-gates/todo-analyzer.mjs + check-placeholders.mjs). It
# re-implements the practical intent in self-contained bash: catch the agent
# leaving a TODO/FIXME/placeholder/"not implemented" stub in a NON-test source
# file.
#
# Unlike the other three advisory hooks, this one escalates via the existing
# progressive-strike mechanism (guard-strikes.sh):
#   strike 1 -> warn (allow)
#   strike 2 -> ask  (permission prompt)
#   strike 3 -> block
# Rationale: TODO/placeholder language in committed code is the CLAUDE.md
# "No fake implementations" rule; repeated offenses in a session warrant
# escalation, matching how scope-guard treats repeated scope violations.
#
# Test files (*.test.* / *.spec.*) are NOT strike-eligible: TODO/placeholder
# language in tests is routine (describing pending cases, fixture stubs).
#
# Patterns (case-insensitive) — only the high-signal subset of the
# todo-analyzer engine, kept to single-file grep for hook-time speed:
#   \bTODO\b \bFIXME\b \bXXX\b \bHACK\b \bTBD\b
#   "not implemented" "implement later" "coming soon" "placeholder"
#   stub-return shapes: return null;? // TODO ; throw new Error("not implemented")
#
# env: none (strike count fixed at 3 via guard-strikes.sh).

# weakening detection of real stubs (CAWS-SHORTCUT-LANG-DESCRIPTIVE-FALSE-POSITIVE-001).
# Discipline: we only SUPPRESS a category when EVERY one of its keyword hits is
# determiner-preceded. A single active marker anywhere still strikes.
# The keyword words themselves are included: in a phrase like "the TODO
# placeholder" the word "placeholder" is part of a referenced compound noun
# ("TODO-placeholder"), not an active marker — so a shortcut keyword directly
# before "placeholder" also marks it as a reference.
