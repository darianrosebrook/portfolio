# Fires at end of session. Same fan-out semantics as the other dispatchers.
# Handlers here finalize session artifacts: audit log closeout, worktree
# cleanup reminder, plan-transcript finalize, session-log handoff.
#
# Stop semantics: none of these handlers should block the user -- the
# session is already ending. All non-zero exits are treated as warnings;
# max_exit is reported but no handler short-circuits the chain.
