# PreToolUse dispatcher for Claude Code hooks.
#
# Single entry point invoked from settings.json's PreToolUse block. Reads
# stdin ONCE, sanitizes it via lib/parse-input.sh, then invokes every
# registered handler with HOOK_* env vars inherited and the sanitized
# JSON piped to each handler's stdin.
#
# Handlers self-filter via their own matcher predicate (a case statement
# on $HOOK_TOOL_NAME at the top of the script).
#
# Exit-code aggregation:
#   - First handler exiting 2 short-circuits the remaining handlers and
#     the dispatcher returns 2 (blocking).
#   - Non-zero non-2 exits are warnings; the dispatcher continues and
#     returns the max non-2 code at the end.
#
# Fail-open: if the dispatcher itself errors before any handler runs
# (parser crash, missing lib), it exits 0 rather than blocking the tool.
# Guard infrastructure must not turn its own bugs into tool-call blocks.
