# CAWS Command Safety Gate for Claude Code
# Delegates to classify_command.py for robust command parsing and classification.
# Falls back to bash pattern matching if Python is unavailable.
#
# The Python classifier handles:
#   - Heredoc-aware parsing (won't false-positive on quoted dangerous commands)
#   - Quoted-region stripping (echo "git reset --hard" is safe)
#   - Pipeline-aware dangers (curl | sh)
#   - Context-aware rm classification (safe prefixes vs dangerous targets)
#   - Proper shell segmentation (&&, ||, ;, |)
