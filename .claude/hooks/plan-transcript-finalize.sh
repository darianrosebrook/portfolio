# Plan Transcript Finalize — overwrite each pending plan-transcript
# snapshot with the final turn-end transcript.
#
# Wired into: Stop dispatch.
#
# At hook time:
#   - The agent's turn is ending. The transcript at $TRANSCRIPT_PATH
#     now includes everything that happened: the agent's plan,
#     ExitPlanMode presentation, user approval/rejection, and any
#     subsequent reasoning or tool calls.
#   - $HOME/.claude/.pending-plan-snapshots lists snapshot paths that
#     plan-transcript-snapshot.sh registered earlier in this turn.
#   - For each pending snapshot, overwrite with the final transcript
#     so the file co-located next to the plan represents the FULL
#     conversation context that produced + reviewed the plan.
#   - Drain the pending list (the snapshots are now finalized; future
#     plan presentations in future turns get fresh entries).
#
# Idempotency: this hook is safe to run multiple times. If the pending
# list is empty or doesn't exist, the hook is a no-op.
#
# Companion: plan-transcript-snapshot.sh (PostToolUse on ExitPlanMode)
# is the producer. Both ship together per CAWS-HOOK-PACK-PROMOTE-001.
