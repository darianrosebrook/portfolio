# Plan Transcript Snapshot — capture conversation context at the moment
# the agent presents a plan via ExitPlanMode.
#
# Wired into: PostToolUse with matcher "ExitPlanMode" (self-filters on
# $HOOK_TOOL_NAME at the top).
#
# At hook time:
#   - The agent has finished building the plan (Write/Edit calls done).
#   - ExitPlanMode has just been called to present the plan to the user.
#   - The transcript at $TRANSCRIPT_PATH contains everything up to this
#     moment: exploration, design, tool results, the plan-write itself,
#     and the ExitPlanMode tool_use record.
#   - The user's approval/rejection and any subsequent reasoning are NOT
#     yet in the transcript — those come later in the turn and are
#     captured by plan-transcript-finalize.sh on Stop.
#
# Output:
#   - <plan-path>.transcript.jsonl  — co-located transcript snapshot.
#   - $HOME/.claude/.pending-plan-snapshots — newline-separated list of
#     snapshot paths awaiting Stop-hook finalization (overwrite with
#     the final transcript at turn end).
#
# Privacy note: The transcript is unfiltered. It includes Bash command
# outputs, Read results, and any content that crossed the conversation.
# Sharing the .transcript.jsonl file is equivalent to sharing your full
# session for the turns leading up to the plan. Treat accordingly.
#
# Companion: plan-transcript-finalize.sh (Stop hook) drains the pending
# list and finalizes each snapshot with the turn-end transcript.
# Promoted from Sterling per CAWS-HOOK-PACK-PROMOTE-001.
