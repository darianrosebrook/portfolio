# SessionStart handler — agent self-registration into the .caws/leases/
# liveness substrate (MULTI-AGENT-ACTIVITY-REGISTRY-001).
#
# Sourcing: invoked by dispatch/session_start.sh after parse-input.sh has
# populated HOOK_SESSION_ID. Reads HOOK_INPUT_JSON from stdin (unused for
# this handler beyond the parse-input contract).
#
# Behavior:
#   - Refuses to run when HOOK_SESSION_ID is empty or "unknown" (the
#     parse-input.sh fallback). A lease whose filename is "unknown.json"
#     would collide across every session that hits the same fallback.
#   - Invokes `caws agents register --session-id <id> --platform claude-code
#     --reason session_start` to write the lease through the CLI.
#   - Non-blocking. Any failure of the CLI surfaces as stderr only;
#     SessionStart never fails on hook errors.
#
# IO boundary: this script is the only place that knows about Claude Code's
# SessionStart payload. The CLI receives explicit flags and returns
# CAWS-native JSON. The hook script does not produce additionalContext
# at SessionStart — the parallel-agent surfacing happens at PreToolUse
# via agent-heartbeat.sh.
