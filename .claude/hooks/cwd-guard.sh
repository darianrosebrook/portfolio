# CWD Guard — prevents session crash when working directory is removed
# Mitigates: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34344
#
# When a worktree directory is deleted while Claude is operating inside it,
# any filesystem tool call crashes the session. This hook detects the missing
# CWD before the tool executes and blocks with a recovery suggestion.
#
