#
# CAWS Worktree Write Guard for Claude Code.
#
# Two responsibilities:
#
#   1. Canonical-spec-materialization refusal
#      (WORKTREE-SPEC-CANONICAL-ACCESS-GUARD-001 A1/A2).
#      From inside a linked worktree (git rev-parse --git-common-dir !=
#      git rev-parse --git-dir, after realpath normalization), refuse
#      Read/Write/Edit tool calls whose file_path resolves under
#      <linked-worktree>/.caws/specs/*. Such files would be private
#      materialized copies of canonical spec authority, divergent from
#      the canonical .caws/specs bytes, silently consulted by anything
#      that walks cwd upward. The refusal MUST fire BEFORE the broad
#      .caws/* allowlist below, otherwise the allowlist would exit 0
#      first and the slice would appear implemented while the target
#      path still bypassed the guard. The canonical checkout itself
#      (git_common_dir == git_dir) IS spec authority and is allowed
#      through this predicate; this refusal targets the linked-worktree
#      materialization class only.
#
#   2. Base-branch write enforcement (intentionally fail-open for
#      v11.1, restored in CLI-WORKTREE-001). The hook serves as the
#      managed-install seat for the worktree-write enforcement surface
#      and asserts the always-allowed allowlist so .caws/, .claude/,
#      docs/, scripts/, tmp/, and tests/ writes are never inadvertently
#      blocked by a future enforcement pass that forgets the allowlist.
#
# Worktree-active enforcement (when restored) must read the worktrees
# registry under both shapes:
#   v11 direct-key: { "<name>": { ... } }
#   v10 nested:     { "worktrees": { "<name>": { ... } } }
# and accept both specId (v10) and spec_id (v11) on entries.
