# CAWS God-Object Advisory Check (QG-HOOKS-EXTRACT-001)
#
# Advisory-only PostToolUse hook firing on Write/Edit. Flags source files
# whose source-lines-of-code (SLOC) exceed a configurable threshold, the
# edit-time analogue of the quality-gates `god_object` gate
# (packages/quality-gates/check-god-objects.mjs, which classifies at
# warning=1750/critical=2000/severe=3000 SLOC). This hook uses a single
# configurable warn threshold (default 2000, the critical tier) for advisory
# simplicity — it NEVER blocks, NEVER mutates, and does NOT import or invoke
# any quality-gates module. It re-implements the intent (large modules are a
# refactoring signal) in self-contained bash.
#
# SLOC = non-blank, non-comment lines. The counter is deliberately simple
# (strips // and # line comments and blank lines); it is an advisory signal,
# not a precise multi-language SLOC engine.
#
# env:
#   CAWS_GOD_OBJECT_LOC   warn threshold in SLOC (default 2000)
