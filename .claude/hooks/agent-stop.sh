# Stop handler — marks the current session's lease as stopped on clean
# session exit (MULTI-AGENT-ACTIVITY-REGISTRY-001).
#
# Sourcing: invoked by dispatch/stop.sh after parse-input.sh has populated
# HOOK_SESSION_ID.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Refuses on empty/unknown HOOK_SESSION_ID.
#   - Invokes `caws agents stop --session-id <id> --platform claude-code`
#     which writes a mark_stopped LeasePatch (status: stopped, stopped_at
#     timestamp). The lease file is preserved as evidence; hard deletion
#     happens only via explicit `caws agents prune`.
#   - Non-blocking. Stop semantics already require all handlers to be
#     best-effort; a Stop failure is a warn, not a block.
#
# Note: Stop is NOT a guaranteed signal. A SIGKILL'd or crashed Claude
# Code session never reaches Stop. The primary liveness mechanism is
# heartbeat — Stop is the clean-exit optimization that lets observers
# distinguish "stopped cleanly" from "went stale and is presumed dead."
