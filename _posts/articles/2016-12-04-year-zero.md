This is a post for the beginner, the fresh meat, and the starry eyed out there
who are getting their hands dirty with design as a self taught designer. *Fist
Bump to You!*

*(I’m packaging up the resources that helped me get where I am towards the end)*

### Today is the day.

It is weird to think that I started my first course of web design and branding a
year ago today. It wasn’t my goal or intention because I had intended to get a
job in marketing as an assistant marketer. They just wanted me to be able to say
that I know some things about HTML and CSS. I said that I could do it no problem
and snuck in a refresher course of HTML and CSS. Little did I know what
“knowing” in their standards was being a code wizard in the form of a marketer.

I worked really hard at refreshing my knowledge and to my disdain, it wasn’t
enough for their job requirements. At that point I had a choice: Continue
working my day job where I was unfulfilled as a creative mind or pursue
something that I had no prior experience doing professionally. I chose not to be
passed over again because of my lack of knowledge of digital skillsets like code
and design. There was a fire lit underneath me and it was going to be a bumpy
ride.

### What mindset do you have?

My mindset was ready for this career change. I started feeling the fire lit
underneath me a few months after having our son, Atlas. We’ve lived here in our
small 1 bedroom apartment poor as could be and in debt, but somehow complacent
enough to not do anything about it. We had outlets that let us escape from that
tiny bit of reality, but when we found out we were expecting our son (this will
sound very cliché), *everything changed*. There are certain moments that I hope
you have in your life where the “beds of roses” you have around your life start
to show what they really are. Maybe they are really nice beds of roses, who
knows. Mine were not and some things had to change.

I knew that learning a new skill set outside of a college or technical course
was going to double the length of time I had to get something going. I chose
however to continue learning outside of the realm of “traditional education,”
treating the pursuit of the career as a full time job. *(My second full time
job, mind you.)* The first two months were crucial to how I chose my path to be
where I am now.

#### Month One: November — End of job search, start of education

After getting that first rejection on a job that I tried really hard for, I knew
it was time to learn more about websites and design. My education had to be as
low cost as humanly possible. Sara and I were cutting out extra spending where
we could and education didn’t really have a place in our budget.

I was following along with this great resource by [Christopher Pound on how to
become a web
developer](https://christopherpound.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer) which
lists some of the best resources for learning code as a self taught web
developer as well as a career path for being a full stack developer.

I also had found [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) which lets you take
some of their courses for free with basic tutorials on using code with a “copy
this — do that” style. These were crucial to me understanding that I had
something that could be great.

#### Month two: December — Start of a crazy year

I was looking for a coding boot camp to help increase my skills. I recommend you
research and ask around for what others have used and what worked for them. With
the advent of the internet, anyone can put a course online and say they’re an
expert. The hard part of you being the beginner is that you don’t know what you
don’t know. I found [Skillcrush.com](https://skillcrush.com/) which had classes
being offered on what I wanted to learn and learned a lot with their Web
Designer blueprint. The price was reasonable to learning to code versus what you
would pay at a college for a similar course. The design section was what I was
lacking. Before the course I had no idea how important it was to put a system in
place for your sites. (Rookie mistake, I know)

Because of how thirsty I was for more information as well as how determined I
was to make a career switch, I learned too quickly for the coding parts of the
blueprint. Even though I was learning fast, it still wasn’t enough to do what I
needed to.

This didn’t stop me from pursuing design, there are still [plenty of things you
can do as a beginner](https://skillcrush.com/category/free-tech-resources/) in
tech.

### My first year and what I have learned

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dCnz8N3ZF1IW3H4B.jpg)

So what did I do? It was almost 2016 and I was borrowing a laptop from my ex. I
needed to have proper tools for me to do my work. I got myself a laptop that
could run the design programs I needed with little difficulty. I got a few
micron pens and some [Baron Fig sketchbooks](https://www.baronfig.com/). I
played with graphic design software like Gimp and Inkscape which are free tools,
as well as using the “trial version” of Photoshop and Illustrator.

#### Don’t be afraid to do a job for free. Just don’t stay in that mindset.

I could have gotten a lot more money upfront with my designs, especially if I
had stayed within my own target market. I did jobs that I won’t show on my
portfolio because a lot of the work isn’t what I want to be known for. But a
small bit of projects that I have been putting up have been free work, stuff
that I felt I wanted to do, but the client wasn’t a great fit for my price
range. I wanted to make sure I had projects on my site versus money in the bank
from them. It was a strategic goal to help me out in the long term versus the
short term.

#### You can’t have everything for free

I had to get the laptop, it set me back in price. I also had to buy my domain
name and the boot camp course. My investment was almost 1500 USD before I had
made any money in tech. (It was a huge amount for someone with close to
nothing.) I made a good portion of this back with one of my first jobs, even if
it wasn’t the side of design I had wanted to be in. But there were still more
costs to be able to do my work. I needed something that allowed me to create
good quality mockup designs for the sites and create assets to be used in those
mockups. So I had chosen to pay for the Adobe Creative Cloud. I needed to buy a
business license for the work I would be doing as a freelancer. I would need to
spend money on a few more things, but the theme is pretty much the same. All of
these costs come at a price that really would be worth it towards the end. It’s
just that there are so many prices of things that I never thought I would be
spending on.

#### Not everyone will support you

I have heard from at least six other people that I need to “have real
expectations about design careers” and that having a career as an artist isn’t
going to pay the bills. (well, right now they were right about that, but that’s
for later.) They also said that a designer is really a sellout who makes art for
money. They’re all wrong. I got this.

#### I found a few great communities to have support and give support to others like
myself.

I have talked about [why designers and developers need to find a
community](https://darianrosebrook.com/archive/why-developers-and-designers-need-to-engage-in-a-community)
to join. If you haven’t joined one, that’s okay, but you’re missing out on the
wonderful things that can come out of it. Like my friends across various
communities:

* [Timo Keurentjes ](https://twitter.com/systimotic): who is a crazy talented
developer with a not-so-secret love for many things Javascript.
* [Tyrel Chambers](https://twitter.com/chambers43): Who was my first client, we
grew together cheering each other on and [continue doing work
together](http://keyspark.io/).
* [Justin Jackson ](https://twitter.com/mijustin): An insanely cool podcaster,
maker, father, and product person. He teaches what he knows and [helps people
grow too](https://justinjackson.ca/about/).
* [Ross Litzenberger ](https://twitter.com/RHLitz): Ross is great with git and
rails, and never fails to help out when I’ve accidentally created merge
conflicts or broke something in code.
* [Andrew Krause ](https://twitter.com/AKrauseDesign): A [great
developer](http://www.akrausedesign.com/) and a surprisingly good designer as
well.
* [Pavel Ispravnikov ](https://twitter.com/pavelisp): Always present and
representative of the people he supports. I have seen him across many things
that DevTips does and respect his advice on designs.
* [Michael Weibel](http://twitter.com/smeyke_) : A designer with a love for great
typography and an [excellent photographer](http://instagram.com/smeyke).

To them and to everyone else who wasn’t mentioned who has also supported me
along the way, you guys mean a whole lot to me. I really appreciate the
conversations we’ve had and that you guys took the time to help a pleb like me.

#### I barely had any chance of a full night’s sleep in over a year.

Partly because I have a child that likes to wake up in the mornings around 5am.
I didn’t ditch my day job partly because my pursuit of design didn’t quite have
a lot of money up front for someone who had baby skills in design and
development. So I was restricted to 40.5 hours a week working at the very job I
was trying to get rid of, leaving me to [fit in being a dad, working a day job,
and doing design
work](https://darianrosebrook.com/archive/handling-expectational-debt-and-falling-behind)
into my everyday life. I’ve kept this up for as long as I remember starting
design a year ago.

#### I should have kept investing in my health.

*and drank less beer*.

I have gained more weight this year with both stress and unhealthy habits than I
have the previous 4 years. There was “no time” to do so, but it was really me
just making excuses. Your health matters as well, and even with all the
craziness, afford yourself at least 20 minutes of some sort of activity that
gives you a small workout each day.

#### I got engaged, and a month later un-engaged

It’s like being Alladin, soaring over the world and having that rug pulled out
from you. You’re excited because you’re building something that will be great
for your family, (fiance and son), and then that idea of family, it’s just gone.
I’m a little miffed by it still, but I know that my son’s future is still better
by me waking up and working hard for this. He’s my north star and I won’t let
anything keep me from providing for him and myself.

#### I got on with a group of talented developers as the Lead Designer

I am very thankful they have had enough hustle to keep up with me and my crazy
life, I am also thankful that they accepted me even with my lack of history. I
have no doubt that they will be better now that they have a consulting brand
identity designer and web designer.

#### Don’t underestimate the leverage of curating your work.

Doing work that you don’t want to be known for, writing a case study about it,
and sharing it only bring more people who want you to do that work. Further
pulling you away from where you would like to go. A small portion of my work
can’t be shared because of this and it ultimately doesn’t further me towards my
goals. It was money and not much more than that. I started curating two types of
work, doing my case studies (which now are being rewritten) and sharing only the
work I wanted to do. Works like a charm.

#### I should have created a process sooner.

I was aimless and haphazardly going about where I learned from, not really
paying attention to the levels they were teaching but also how much time I spent
there versus how much I actually practiced or did work for clients.

I have created a [Process Page](https://darianrosebrook.com/process). I love
having something to reference or point to.

### When it comes down to a tl;dr

What I learned from my journey:

* Not everyone is going to be nice and supportive when you do something different.
* There are plenty of people who go through the same things you do, you just have
to go find them.
* Learn the guiding principles before trying to learn the tools and do crazy
things. That means you need to learn it so well that you start to see what’s
wrong with road signs, take-out menus, and how misaligned and asymmetrical
everyone’s bodies actually are by design.
* Treat your self-teaching with the same level of intensity as your job. It is one
and you are a fool to think that learning without applying will get you
anywhere. Go out and make things.
* Even if there seems to be nothing going right along your journey, there’s no
reason to quit. Nothing of quality comes in this life without hard work.
* Don’t undervalue yourself with the job boards and $5 logo sites, you’re better
than that. It’s a good place to start to see that people will pay for work you
do, but they are vicious there and will constantly try to devalue the time,
effort, and difficulty it is to do creative work.
* I have consumed nearly 500 videos, podcast episodes, and resources that helped
frame my mind towards design thinking and teaching the hard skills and soft
skills needed to do my work.
* Read, read, and re–read the books, articles you’ve saved, and tutorials.
* In pursuing anything, you’ll learn more than just that thing. I’ve found that I
have been learning how to market and sell my services, display my work, manage
social media accounts for growth building. It keeps bubbling out there.
* You have value. You matter. And no one but you can tell yourself that.

### Resources on where to start.

* Look up [hackdesign.org](http://hackdesign.org/) and get on the list for their
curated resources, articles, and videos.
* Get online with some free courses to practice like
[freeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org/) and
[Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/) and [So You Want to be a Web
Developer](https://darianrosebrook.com/archive/(https://christopherpound.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer))
* Books: [Making and Breaking the
Grid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592531253/), [Thinking with
Type](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695),

Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515),
and [any of these from A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/).
* Get on a site like [Briefbox](http://briefbox.me/) which is a site that gets you
some of the best practice briefs and preps you for design thinking and tackling
both challenges and deadlines.
* Get into some communities like [Compass of
Design](https://compassofdesign.com/), Design Mentors, and
* Watch this talk by [Mike Monteiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U)
about getting paid for work.
* Start looking around on YouTube for people doing some great work like [The
Futur](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSkoolRocks/videos), [Will
Patterson](https://www.youtube.com/user/breakdesignsco/videos), and
[Swerve](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9kxpA_FHEsXX1xWMb-Egow), [Mackenzie
Child](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWZwsP8trUy5uHJg8gcGIQ), and [J
Fremaint](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0o60y3FtVy3M93JcDFVreA).
* Get some good podcasts in like [MegaMaker](http://megamaker.co/podcast), [Late
Nights with Trav and Los](http://travandlos.com/), and even though there’s only
one free one to listen to each week, [The seanwes
Podcast](http://seanwes.com/podcast) is still a great podcast too.
* Look for great articles from
[invision](https://darianrosebrook.com/archive/blog.invisionapp.com), [A List
Apart](http://alistapart.com/articles), and [me
*Wink*](https://darianrosebrook.com/archive/articles)

You are in control of what you know. Do what you will with what I have just
given.

### You have value. You matter to people. And you have “oh so much to learn.”

#### Get out there and be creative.

This! This is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you so much for documenting
your process thru learning design! I am currently starting on this path and have
read countless articles about design, for designers, and tho informative and
useful they don’t really speak to self- teaching a beginner. Ive spent
considerable time researching and reading…

Joelene. Thanks for the response, you and I have a few things in common for
sure. I know what it’s like to start when there’s not a lot of money to throw at
a side-hustle.
