I’m going to (probably incorrectly) guess that you don’t deal with being
stressed out over all the design work you have to do, the emails coming in, the
phone calls you miss, the family time you’re running late to…

*You probably don’t deal with being overwhelmed at all.*

I bet you don’t even deal with the mountain of tasks inside your head that you
actually have a clear idea of what you have to do and what is most important.

#### Me neither.

It feels like all of the stuff that I have to keep up with is all really hard on
me. Most of the time I feel overwhelmed. Maybe I’m just overthinking it, but it
feels like the image below a lot of the time.

### How do you deal with all of it?

#### **We need to get better at clearing our minds when we feel overwhelmed…**

When I started writing this, I’ve felt pretty stressed out and heavy headed.

As a founder of my own design agency, I have very little time to be applied to
everything. I run two brands, work full time on the side, I have a family,
housekeeping (that I’m falling behind on)… it can be a lot of work trying to get
everything done.

I’ve been realizing that I am falling farther behind and forgetting important
things. It’s overwhelming at best, and brutally crushing at its worst.

There’s a lot going up in my head, and without the right habits in place, I’m
sure to turn out like the picture above.

### You need to get better at clearing your head.

#### **Best way of getting your head on straight?**

You need to **start writing to clear your head**. Write down everything that
you’ve tried to get done last week. List as much as you can remember, and hey,
list some tasks that you might do on autopilot (like make coffee, go grocery
shopping, email your boss back).

These are the things you’ve tried to do for the whole week.

Now put a line through everything that you have completed. Are you getting all
of the things you need to done? How about the things you wanted to do but didn’t
have time for?

If you got all of them done, you can now write the things that you need to get
done next week down on paper.

Paper and pen is magical because it forces the things in your brain to the paper
using motor skills. I find this helps most with memory when trying to recall
what you have to be doing. But you can use anything you want, just get it out of
your head for the moment.

Keeping a document of any sorts that contains a list of things you need to
accomplish is the first step towards having all that weight lifted off your
shoulders. Your next step is to start prioritizing them, but we’ll get to that
in a moment.

If you want to see what things I have to do for the 3 brands (kind of a free
flowing list) [you can check that out
here.](https://coggle.it/diagram/WYIHnOItEQABf1oB/13b6337caa14735b0590e140187b8de516153bb583480d8042220a0298904c36)

### Yeah, even all that design learnin’ isn’t helping either.

#### **I used to think I have to learn all of the things I don’t know yet.**

The amount of knowledge out there to learn from is infinite. As much as you try,
you’re not going to be able to learn all of it in a day.

You might not even learn all of it in a year.

Your goal for your design education should always be mastering the basics first.
As you start to grow in your skills, you find that you need more than just the
basics, you need special knowledge and need to learn other things that aren’t
just design.

The thing we forget or might not know is that the fastest way to learn something
is to practice. We just don’t have the time to practice everything we “learned’
at once. So what do we do?

You have to have a set of **goals to filter your learning **and a** bias toward
action**.

Chris do goes over this with his [interview and coaching session with Melinda
Livsey:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpY4t_oAXHg)

> Action beats intent

What you need to be doing is to have a goal in mind that you need to accomplish.

If that’s something like “get better at hand lettering” or “learn how to talk
more professionally to clients” your brain is setting up filters for the
material you have begun consuming.

If you’re conscious about that, you will be able to instantly recognize it when
you see it, and therefore create an action step around it. Even subconsciously,
your brain is going to look for what will help it get what it wants right now.

You just have to learn to take action on it.

This bias towards action is key. You want to start implementing and testing what
you learn in the real world setting. If you found a technique that looks good
for brush lettering, grab a tool and start practicing it.

If it’s something that’s a deeper level like understanding how to deal with
imposter syndrome, take more time to reflect on it and create action steps you
can use. Remember, right now you need to focus on what is going to get you
closer to your goal right now, and just take in the necessary information to do
something with it.

### Are you letting yourself and others down?

#### **Who is at fault here? Are they asking too much? Are you over promising
yourself?**

Really, we have to [stop saying yes to
everything](https://smallbusinessforum.co/stop-saying-yes-to-everything-103876fe124).
Open yourself up to saying no once in a while.

Your time is valuable. It’s more valuable to you than the job you trade it for.

It’s more valuable than the buddy who asks you to go to the bar again this
weekend. Your time is the most valuable thing you have, yet we give it away so
freely. After a while, we overestimate that time we have available and get
ourselves in to what’s called [Expectational
Debt](https://darianrosebrook.com/archive/handling-expectational-debt-and-falling-behind).

#### We have two kinds of people who chronically finish things late.

The Procrastinator and the Optimist

**Procrastinators are selfish with their time.**

They think that they have the time to put playful things in front of getting
work done. Procrastinators are those who think that they would “rather be doing
other things” and putting an emphasis on getting to the important tasks later
instead of now.

**Optimists are under-evaluating their time.**

This person is optimistic in the amount of things they can accomplish. They
believe that they have the time to do all of their important tasks before their
deadlines, or before work starts. They underestimate exactly how long a drive
over 35 miles long to have coffee with their friend actually takes. It’s not
with selfish intent that they are adding things to their schedule, they just
want to be able to do more.

I am the optimist; someone who wanted to do more with my time. It was hard to
say “no” to people when opportunities came up and people would ask for something
to be done. After a long while I found myself standing before an insurmountable
mountain of tasks that needed done that I agreed to do.

#### Again, we’re going back to our list of things that we tried to do last week.

Did you fill every available hour with something you wanted to do, had to get
done, or a meeting you had to go to? Really, we need to start giving ourselves
some time to breathe.

### Give yourself a time buffer.

#### **Things actually take longer than you think they do.**

As you fill out your schedule this week, give yourself some time.

Try arriving 5 minutes earlier to work. Wake up earlier to give about an hour to
yourself in the morning before getting ready just to relax?.

Though there’s a lot of things we could get done with those extra minutes and
hours, they do us no good if we’re overwhelmed and exhausted.

It might shock you, but you actually do need to rest sometimes. Your mind is a
muscle to be worked on. Just like hitting the gym, you can’t work your poor mind
to death and expect it to be at peak performance all the time.

Taking breaks can really give you the clearance and clarity you need to keep
improving week to week. So what are some techniques to help not feel overwhelmed
here?

**For tasks, try using the **[pomodoro
technique.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

The basics are that you want to break your time up when learning or working on
something into manageable chunks of time. You want to be as focused as you can
be during the working period and free to do whatever during the break.

1.  Decide on the task to be done.
1.  Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)
1.  Work on the task until the timer rings.
1.  After the timer rings put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
1.  If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then
go to step 2.
1.  After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark
count to zero, then go to step 1.

Repeat this until you are satisfied with the work you’ve done.

#### Take some actual time off.

I’m jealous sometimes of the people that are regularly able to take a vacation.
I don’t really have that ability until I have my business self-sustaining and
not require me putting every waking effort into it.

However, all that time I’m spending on growing my business will do me no good if
I burn out and lose my passion. I have to actually force myself to take breaks
or my fiancé has to step in and tell me I need a break (I love that gal a lot).

This time should be protected and you need to not set tasks to do, take calls or
emails, and just enjoy being you with your family for a little bit.

### We really aren’t good multi-taskers

#### **That doesn’t stop us from trying every now and then.**

[You have to work smarter, not harder](http://cmps.co/hustle-and-grind). Working
smart means taking account of the things you are currently doing and measuring
their effectiveness of reaching your goals. I had to do this with the way that
I’m currently spending time with things in my business.

Maybe I spend too much time trying to do two or three things at a time. I’ll
work on my website, and be responding to email and twitter messages…

Really, I start to become sloppy at all three. Then there’s the topic of doing
one task too many times. All of this can be fixed with delegation or automation.

Areas where I was spending all my time doing one task repeatedly (like setting
up grids in Photoshop/Illustrator, creating title cards for my newsletter, new
client onboarding, countless other things) were bottle-necking how effective I
could be at getting more effective tasks done, (like client work, onboarding new
community members, creating new products).

Eventually you can get to a point where you are able to delegate tasks to others
or even hire other companies or services/software to do things that your time is
better spent not doing.

This level[ takes a bit of hustle ](https://cmps.co/hustle-and-grind)to get to
be able to do it, but when you start to figure out what is important for you to
do, you find that it takes precedence over other tasks. You can decide how far
you are willing to go here.

### What if I fail?

#### **All of these thoughts and tasks need to be attended to, right?**

No. At some point** you will fail **at getting everything done that you wanted
to. You have to be okay with that.

Have a plan in place for when that happens:

1.  **Have people you can go to for help** If you don’t have the time, find someone
you can have help you. If you couldn’t figure out how to do it, find someone who
can and ask for help. It’s okay, and I give you permission to ask anyone if you
need help.
1.  **Give yourself time to re-evaluate your tasks and prioritize them** If you
don’t have the time to get all of the things done, spend just a little bit of
time to put the things that absolutely need done first. Don’t confuse being busy
with being productive.
1.  **Get feedback on what you did**<br>  Don’t stay in a bubble. Talk to someone
about the things you are trying to get done and maybe they have some insight to
things that are effective or experience on if that’s helped them.

Really, when you start to feel like you are getting overwhelmed with everything
going on.

* Take a moment to breathe
* Evaluate your situation
* Get other people involved
* Prioritize your activities

If you haven’t yet, try creating a mind map of everything you got going on and
start there.

In order to take the weight off your shoulders, you need to see it first. So go
through these any time you’re feeling overwhelmed by the insurmountable pile of
things to do.

Hope that helps. (:
