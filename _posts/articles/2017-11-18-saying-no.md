## You might eventually find yourself in a position where you need to say “no” to a
client. Here’s how to do so professionally.

We’re designers because we’re good at making things. We use a lot of our
head-space to think of creative solutions to your client’s problems. We use art,
math, time, and resources to create something that gets our clients closer to
their goals.

The thing is, the world is scarce with people who value the work we do, or even
understand what we do and what it achieves.

I run into that from time to time when people ask me if I could just “really
quickly design a logo for their site” or like the first inquiry that I had who
thought I had agreed to do a design for him and got so angry at me he blocked me
on every social media platform…

The world of design won’t always be a nice and forgiving career, but the
benefits and positives outweigh the negatives for sure.

I have been thinking a lot about my design business. This has lead to a lot of
reading into the business of design, design strategy, ethics, and various topics
on building a creative business. I see it as preparation for things that I will
face when increasing the number of clients I take on, transitioning out of a day
job.

One of the things we will face a lot during our time running a design based
business is having a situation where you either have to say “no” to a client or
being in a situation where you wish you had.

## The cost of saying “Yes”

#### Let’s start with what happens when you say “yes.”

In the words of Sean McCabe from **seanwes, **he says that the word ‘yes’ is a
very expensive word to use. When you agree to do something, you’re actively
filling time that you have.

**Time is the most expensive resource you have. **You will continue to find that
saying no is the best tool you have to ensure your resource of time is protected
and put towards the things that matter.

#### Gut check

Imagine saying “yes” to taking on a new client, and that client turns out to be
such a handful that you wish you hadn’t. What does your gut tell you after
agreeing to take them on as a client?

I have been in plenty of moments where I have regretted saying that I’ll do a
project for people. For some, the entire client wasn’t a good fit, but out of a
mindset of scarcity, I took them on anyway. Other times, it was by underbidding
the project, or not setting proper communication or expectations at the
beginning. We all learn from our past mistakes.

#### So what do you need to do?

[Stop saying yes to
everything.](https://smallbusinessforum.co/stop-saying-yes-to-everything-103876fe124?source=search_post---------0)

**If you want your “yes” to mean anything, you have to value it.**<br> By being
selective, we are actually able to give more power and credibility to our “Yes”

### Say “no” early and often

#### It does make a difference.

In the most recent months, I have found it easier to say no. I have a reason to
actually choose what I say because I value my free time.

My free time allows me to spend more time with my Fiancé and Child.<br> My free
time allows me to work on expanding the value of my design community.<br> My
free time allows me to build products and courses.<br> My free time allows me to
unwind and enjoy my periods of rest.

> **“Say ‘no’ early and often”**<br>  — Blair Enns ([Win without pitching
> manifesto](http://amzn.to/2xffUgi))

Our problem is usually one of quality, not quantity.

A number of quality leads we have are usually smaller than the overall leads we
get (that is if you’ve even made changes to [get more leads from your
portfolio](https://cmps.co/portfolio-that-converts)). We tend to compensate that
lack of quality by taking on as many other clients in as we can.

Imagine, however, the ability to take on fewer clients and be paid the same, if
not more for your efforts…

Selectivity is a mark of a professional. One of the defining characteristics,
building more credibility and reducing the friction of qualified leads taking
you on.

#### The filter

The easiest mark of having a selection process is the conversations that you
have up front. When an opportunity arises, see if you can kill it.

[My current filter is my design questionnaire on my
website](https://cmps.co/client-onboard-1). I’ve had a handful of people (<100)
visit my site for So Magnetic, I have received 16 inquiries since the site went
live. 9 completely filled the questionnaire out. Those were more qualified leads
than I’ve ever had before when I was just using my personal site.

Diving more into the projects allowed me to weed out those projects that still
were not a good fit or were better served by other freelancers (projects that
were for types of design that I don’t do). This still brings value to the client
inquiry because they then have more clarity on what they want, what they need,
and who’s best fit to help them.

Helping a client with clarity is never wasted time. You might even get good
referrals for being honest in the first place.

Just like our reasons for saying yes, by saying no, we are actually able to
avoid headaches later on in the process.

#### You want to be in pursuit of that “No”.

## Need for “No”: Hot pursuit

In order for us to turn down client’s requests, we need to have set parameters
on what we actually will take on.

It would make sense to spend some time working on setting parameters for:

* The type of work you want in your portfolio
* The persona of client that you want to interact with
* The level of budget projects you would like to take on
* How you want to communicate
* How you handle the scope of work
* Any part of your process
* etc

The more you outline in your “ideal client” the easier it is to say “no” to
someone who doesn’t fit the bill. Positioning is a big step towards finding
those right fits. [Something you can do directly from your
website](https://cmps.co/client-onboard-2-b).

> “Clients are going to assume responsibility for anything that you haven’t purely
> defined.<br> It’s your job to set expectations”

So even if the opportunity is right, we still need to be selective with what we
choose to take on. By retreating just a little, someone who really does want to
continue the project will follow.

> “Speak softly and people lean toward you, speak loudly and they will back away.”

Constantly shouting to social media that you’re available really comes across as
a hard sell. By playing “hard to get” (in terms of making the client aware
you’re selective) the client is more likely to follow you.

## Play a strong offense.

#### But don’t go to war with your clients

#### It is important to be firm with your “no.”

**You can’t hem and haw with declining a request in a very clear and concise
manner.**

When we have clients that come in that would not be a good fit to work with,
(maybe because they’re a family member or anyone else you have decided is not
the ideal client), you need to say so explicitly.

### You can’t just “get rid” of a client.

#### So please, for the love of all that is of an elevated sort of manner…

### do not:

* **Quote an abnormally high rate:**
* This is a dishonest and arbitrary way of trying to get rid of someone. If you
don’t want to work with them, say no. Charging them higher than the rest of your
clients based on the fact that you don’t want to work with them just means
you’ll have to take on the client if they accept to not be rude and be stuck
with a client you didn’t want to work with in the first place.
* **Tell them you’re too busy when you’re really not. E.g. “I can’t at this
time”**
* Again, this means that should you then post on social media that you’re taking
on new clients, your client inquiry will see right through your BS and put in
their request again.
* In either case above, if they are someone you’d like to work with, consider a
retainer fee for their spot on your calendar so that you can work together.
* **Ask them to go through your questionnaire when you already know it’s not a
good fit**
* Unless you really do like wasting people’s time for the fun of it.
* **Give any reason outside the truth (probably distilled)**
* Don’t tell them upfront that their project sucks. Don’t tell them that they’re
an asshat. But let them know in a professional manner that they don’t fit the
profile of clients that you work with.

These are lies, and they will require maintenance to keep up. Avoid the nonsense
by being straightforward up-front, and honest.

#### Do not compromise

Never compromise your professionalism. Never compromise on your ethics. Never
compromise on morals. Never compromise on price. Never do work for free in
exchange for “Exposure.”

Somewhere along the lines, if you’re running into areas where you are having to
consider compromising in these areas, there’s a hole in the process. The beauty
of that is because **you as a professional have the responsibility and
capability to change things**.

Though you might be in the situation right now, you can take time after the
engagement to audit your process and see why the situation popped up and do
something to safeguard against it in the future.

#### So what do you say?

You be honest. Tell them:

> Hey, [name]

> Thanks so much for getting in touch. I really appreciate you taking the time to
> send an inquiry and provide your project information.

> I am very selective about the projects I take on. After much consideration with
> your project request, based on my project criteria, I will have to decline your
project.

> I do want to sincerely thank you for your time and interest.<br> If you would
> like, I do have colleages I can pass your request along to, just let me know.

> All the best,

> [your name]

## Surprise!

> “You still have me over here, waiting for you to revise this design for the 8th
> time”

### The client you already have

I know that all of these situations above tend to safeguard us from taking on
difficult clients that aren’t a good fit.

However, what happens when you already have a client that is requesting things
that you know will be (even just slightly) outside of what you both agreed on?

“But it’s a small change, it shouldn’t take you any time at all”<br> “I’m the
one paying for this project”<br> “We need to change [date, request, colors,
etc]”

#### Have a conversation first

The thing about being in the client engagement already makes this a very sticky,
tricky, and potentially legal battle to fight with clients.

You need to have empathy for where the client is coming from and you need to
have conversations around what the client’s expectations are. Maybe the request
is a simple misunderstanding, and maybe the request is due to the client needing
to take charge.

It’s your responsibility to clear this up and continue the project the best you
can.

#### Be firm

It won’t be easy to navigate having to tell a current client “no” during an
active client engagement. For whatever reason, your client has come to you in
order to add a detail, start another revision, change the style completely, or
go back and change a small thing.

**You need to have certain processes in place in order to safeguard yourself
from situations like this.**

Everything up to this point has been as part of your written or un-written
design process, contract, or design proposal.

Somewhere along the way, there was a miscommunication, either you weren’t able
to fully understand the client’s vision (or they couldn’t convey it clear
enough), or the client misunderstands what you both agreed upon.

#### **The first line of action is to check the request.**

1.  Does this request require me to compromise (see the last section) my
professionalism?
1.  How much time and effort will this request take to complete?
1.  Is this going to make or break our client engagement?

You need to **check the list above to see if this request is going to be
feasible **within the client’s scope of project.

You then need to **audit the request to see if there was any miscommunication
**between you two that got you to where you are now.

You may have to **tell your client that you cannot do the request **because of
processes in place, time restraints, feasibility, ethics. etc. Just **do not
lie. Be honest.**

If saying “no” to the request makes the client want to break the engagement, you
may have to consider 2 things:

1.  Go along with the request (as long as it doesn’t break too much) and fix your
process to avoid that in the future. Take this as a clear example of what to
avoid/fix for future engagements.
1.  Have a sit down with the client, redo the project discovery to get a full and
complete picture of where the client was expecting the project to go, if any
goals have changed, clearing up any misconceptions and then starting the process
from there with a new proposal and contract.

If it will break the engagement, and it will compromise your integrity as a
person, professional, or a designer. Don’t let it devalue the work we do as
designers. Tell the client no. Firmly. And that the course of action is to
continue with the project as planned, or to stop the project entirely.

#### Seek outside help

Having someone outside of the situation to go to can be of great help when
looking for advice. Whether it be a mentor, someone you can go to for legal
advice, colleagues, other designers, you might be able to get help with
navigating the situation.

These situations aren’t easy to navigate at all.

If you want help, [we have a community of
designers](https://compassofdesign.com/community) from UX, UI, Web, Graphic,
Data, Print designers, along with developers of sorts who have all had
experience with the aspects of client work.

### In the end

Taking time to put processes in place in order to avoid these situations will be
your best armor for avoiding these situations entirely. But eventually, there’s
going to be a situation where you have to say “no.”

Say so with a firm, clear, and consise manner that is professional. Don’t burn
bridges. Remember that word of mouth is still your biggest ally in client work,
and your professionalism on how you handle these situations will determine
whether that word of mouth helps you or hinders you when searching for new
clients to work with.<br>  <br> **Don’t be afraid to tell a client no in order
to protect the value of your work and the work of every other designer out there
in the world.**
