title: Writing more effective case studies
description: Writing case studies is a difficult task for many beginners. Some people claim that a case study doesn’t have to contain a lot of info and that you only need to show what you did, add a paragraph and call it good. Some people say you don’t even need to write case studies for everything, that you should use a dribbble.com account, or a Behance account and post you work there.

## How you present your designs really does make a difference

Writing case studies is a difficult task for many designers. One of the last
things we want to do after having spent weeks on a design is to write a document
about it. You could argue that just putting a paragraph of what it was on your
site would work. Maybe just forgo the writing and put this on your Dribbble or
Behance account and *let the like button do it’s magic.*

Better than that, you should explain your process and how you came to the final
result. Though it feels like a secret, there’s one skill that truly helps a
designer outshine their peers. That skill is their ability to recognize and
address the opportunity around an existing problem and how to solve for it.

A designer must trust in the design process to do the heavy lifting regarding
how design decisions are handled throughout this project. It’s not rocket
science because even a basic process will elevate and automate your projects
allowing for a more efficient solution. The person that is going to view your
case study isn’t only there for how awesome your design may be, they want to
know what worked, how you came to your solution, and whether you have the skills
to come up with a solution for them.

### Where in the process do you write the case study?

This is a trick question, you should be documenting as you go. So, of course it
all starts with writing. Throughout your design process, you have certain
stages, and they usually fall under a few sections:

1.  Meeting the client;
1.  Discovering Goals;
1.  Starting the Research;
1.  Sketching and Iterating;
1.  Prototyping and Conceptualizing;
1.  Presentation;
1.  Delivery.

Starting to document throughout this process is a crucial thing to writing clear
and effective case studies. This is information you can distill and hand to the
client AND refine for presentation on the web as your case study.

### What are the ingredients of a good case study?

Like a good recipe, a case study is filled with many different sections. It
needs to be digestible and appealing to the new and prospective clients. If you
are going to show work, it should be a great representation of what you can do
and how you can help someone achieve similar results.

A case study is best served with:

1. Background on the project and client

2. The scope of the project and your role in it

3. A defined challenge or opportunity to improve

4. Clearly define what the outcome was

5. Clear examples of pre-work and finished work

Numbers drive a lot of trust as well. A client wants to be able to trust that
your work can satisfy their goals. It speaks to the level of quality that your
work produces and it satiates the hungry-for-ever-improving-metrics monster that
lives inside most entrepreneurs and large businesses.

### Automate your writing process

Writing needs to be part of your workflow. It doesn’t have to start as large
articles every morning, but what would make writing easier is to start with
small snippets. Grab yourself a cheap notebook to write in that when you start
your work for the day, it will be nearby. When a decision comes along, jot down
specifically why you are changing, creating, or keeping a part of the project.
The notes can be a bulleted list:

* Changed the size of our header to reduce vertical space on tablets
* Switched our alternate color from #f2f2f2 to #4cd653 because I’m a slime-green
loving masochist and that color better fits the brand’s goal of being more edgy
and fun
* Worked on replacing the headings font from rounded slab-serif to a thin
sans-serif, but kept it due to conflicting visual patterns.

Your notes do not have to be paragraphs in length, but even if you only document
the biggest decisions like this, you’ll have a large list of decisions to
reference when presenting the result to the client.

<span class="figcaption_hack">This is, without a doubt, my cruddy handwriting.</span>

After each stage of your design process, you should put time into writing a
short summary of the phase and the decisions made throughout. Questions like:
“What went well during this phase?”; “What could be improved upon when going
through this phase next time?”; “What major decisions have started to shape the
solution?”; and “What challenges did you overcome during this phase?”; can all
affect how effective your message is when presenting the case study.

### Be honest

A client’s trust is the reason that you will get that call or email about
starting new projects. Showing the client what went well and what challenges had
to be overcome are real ways of earning that trust before the brief. If you’re
planning to entice clients, too much rough stuff without a clear outcome of
overcoming might not be best. But lying about how you achieved a certain area
against what actually happened won’t put you in a good position with the client
that you worked with.

If there are areas where you did an iteration that wasn’t working, be upfront
about it and explain why you went in a different direction. If there was a tool
or process that wasn’t working, put how you overcame that in writing. A lot of
designers look for great case studies to learn from and yours might just help
them avoid that same mistake. Showing this whole process is great for when your
goal is to get hired or work with other designers and agencies.

Speak about what you loved most about the work and the parts that went well.

### Don’t forget to ask for the results and a testimonial.

Your client is also on the ride with you. You are taking them along to reach the
solution that was outlined during the goals and opportunities phase of your
process. After the project, it is entirely fair to ask the client about their
experience working with you, how designing their project went, and what the end
results were. If everything goes through without major issues, a client probably
is not looking to tarnish or damage your reputation. The result should be
pushing the client towards their goals and achieving them after the work is
finished. Ask the client to provide a few sentences to a paragraph of how their
experience was when working with you, and if they are willing, what the results
of the project were. These results can be in the form of revenue from the
redesign, follower growth, decreasing amount of complaints, and satisfaction and
decrease in bounce rates.

*Outline the best in your case study.*

If you have the habit of writing in place when working on projects, you should
be able to grow your practice and attract higher quality clients who are looking
for the results that you provide. Writing case studies is not an easy task, but
with practice and iteration, your case studies will become just as natural as
creating the best solutions for your clients.

Not every wheel needs to be reinvented. Automating isn’t just great for
increasing the efficiency of a task you do often, but can also help you develop
a habit for doing a task (I’m looking at you, New Years Resolutions).

I totally agree.

One element I include in my case studies is insight. What was the “Aha!” moment
when the data led to some realization that ultimately turned into a viable
client solution? This lets anyone who reads the case study get a glimpse into
how you think—not just what you did.

Rocket science?

2500 people have seen this and you’re the only person to say something about it.
Hahaha

Probably some mental auto-complete going on :)
