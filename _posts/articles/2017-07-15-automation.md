# Automating Your Product

Why should you develop a product that you have to update every few months? For
example, you have to update your copyright every year, but with a few lines of
script you can do that yourself.

The best solutions are the ones that fix themselves over time. Details such as a
copyright, or dates, or even colors based on the time of day can all be done for
you.

> **You can build a static website with dynamic details that automate your
> processes.**

Design your work to compensate for the ever-changing landscapes *(and portraits)
*in order to minimize the amount of maintenance that you have to do each month.

**What can you automate?**

* Copyrights *(those pesky things that keep your work yoursf)*
* Due dates and other important dates
* Content based on the height and width of the viewport
* The overall color palette based on the time of day

### Automation shouldn’t replace creativity

Your work shouldn’t have to look like sh*t just because you made something
update automatically. Websites describe who you are as a person, so if you make
a dumb site (technically speaking), then it might show that you’re a dumb person
(again, technically speaking).

> Site maintenance isn’t about **updating** the same things, its **changing**
> content to keep the main thing the main thing, but for an **updated **audience.

### Resilience Over Redundancy

You should always prefer to reuse code rather than recreate it with one
different variable. Write less code that does more in the end so that you can do
more with the time you just saved yourself.
