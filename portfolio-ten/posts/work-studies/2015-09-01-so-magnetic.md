# Overview

I have spent the last few years as a freelance Brand Identity Designer doing consultancy at So Magnetic. Here, I identify areas of opportunities for companies and create unity within a brand's design system and update, refresh, or unify their image.

Since growing at the end of 2016, I have expanded a few pet projects from here as well. Running a newsletter and article system as well as online training and digital resources with other designers under Compass of Design
