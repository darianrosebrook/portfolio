I just joined the Microsoft Edge team for a year's contract to help design Edge's new Chromium based browser. I'll be doing some fun work on helping design features with developer experiences, as well as helping shape the way Microsoft Edge runs a product design project. This will be some great work with both DesignOps and Development experiences.
