## üö® **Recovery Context**

**What Happened:**
- Previous comprehensive optimizations were working successfully
- Git failure occurred during merge process, causing project revert
- All optimization work from "when I said we're not working on main" onwards was lost
- Need to recover optimizations from git stashes

**Available Stashes:**
- `stash@{0}`: WIP on main (lighthouse performance results)
- `stash@{1}`: Performance optimization files (5 files)
- `stash@{2}`: Comprehensive optimizations (100+ files) ‚≠ê **PRIMARY RECOVERY SOURCE**

**Git References for Future Context:**
```bash
# View stash contents
git stash list
git stash show stash@{2} --name-only
git show stash@{2}:next.config.mjs
git show stash@{2}:package.json

# Recovery commands
git stash apply stash@{2}
git stash pop stash@{1}
```

**Key Commit Hashes & Branch References:**
- **Current recovery branch:** `ca903e0f` (feature/optimization-recovery)
- **Base gooey branch:** `19fa86a5` (origin/feature/gooey-text-highlighting)
- **Main branch:** `origin/main` (stable base)
- **Available branches:** main, feature/gooey-text-highlighting, fix/typescript-route-handlers
- **Recovery starting point:** commit `cdee8e7b` (initial TODO.md creation)

## üîÑ **Recovery Progress**

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Assessment & Setup**
- [x] Created recovery branch `feature/optimization-recovery`
- [x] Analyzed available stashes
- [x] Identified comprehensive stash with optimizations
- [x] Created this TODO.md for progress tracking

### üöß **Phase 2: Stash Recovery - IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] **Resolve current conflicts** (app/globals.scss, tsconfig.json)
- [ ] **Apply comprehensive stash** (`stash@{2}`)
- [ ] **Verify key optimizations are restored**

**Current Conflicts to Resolve:**
1. **app/globals.scss** - Gooey highlighting styles vs optimization styles
2. **tsconfig.json** - Strict mode setting (current: true, stash: likely false)

### üéØ **Phase 3: Key Optimizations to Restore**

**From Stash Analysis - These Were Working:**

#### **Next.js Configuration** (`next.config.mjs`)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Verified in stash** - Bundle analyzer integration
- [ ] Image optimization (WebP/AVIF, device sizes, cache TTL)
- [ ] Performance optimizations (package imports, compression)
- [ ] Console removal in production
- [ ] Power-by header removal

#### **Package Dependencies** (`package.json`)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Verified in stash** - Testing infrastructure added
- [ ] Vitest testing framework
- [ ] Bundle analyzer (`@next/bundle-analyzer`)
- [ ] Testing libraries (@testing-library/*, @axe-core/react)
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools

#### **TypeScript Fixes** (API Routes)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Verified in stash** - Next.js 15 compatibility
- [ ] `app/api/articles/[slug]/route.ts` - Proper params typing
- [ ] `app/api/publish/route.ts` - Route handler signatures
- [ ] All API routes using `Promise<{ slug: string }>` pattern

#### **Missing Critical Files** (Need to be recreated)
- [ ] **Vitest Configuration** (`vitest.config.ts`)
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure** (`test/` directory)
  - [ ] `test/setup.ts` - Test environment setup
  - [ ] `test/api/articles.test.ts` - API route tests
  - [ ] `test/components/*.test.tsx` - Component tests
- [ ] **Performance Components**
  - [ ] `app/BlueprintsWrapper.tsx` - Lazy loading wrapper
  - [ ] `components/PerformanceDashboard/` - Performance monitoring
  - [ ] `utils/performance/` - Performance utilities
  - [ ] `utils/caching/` - Advanced caching system
- [ ] **Service Worker** (`public/sw.js`)
- [ ] **Offline Page** (`app/offline/page.tsx`)

## üìã **Detailed Recovery Tasks**

### **Immediate Actions Needed:**

1. **Resolve Current Conflicts:**
   ```bash
   # Handle globals.scss - decide which styles to keep
   # Handle tsconfig.json - verify strict mode setting
   git add app/globals.scss tsconfig.json
   git commit -m "temp: resolve conflicts before stash recovery"
   ```

2. **Apply Comprehensive Stash:**
   ```bash
   git stash apply stash@{2}
   ```

3. **Verify Core Files Restored:**
   - Check `next.config.mjs` has bundle analyzer
   - Check `package.json` has testing dependencies
   - Check API routes have proper TypeScript signatures

### **Performance Infrastructure to Recreate:**

#### **Testing Infrastructure:**
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts - Path aliases and test setup
// test/setup.ts - requestIdleCallback polyfill for accessibility tests
// test/api/ - API route tests with Next.js 15 compatibility
// test/components/ - Component tests with CSS module imports
```

#### **Performance Optimizations:**
```typescript
// app/BlueprintsWrapper.tsx - Dynamic import for heavy components
// utils/performance/monitor.ts - Core Web Vitals tracking
// utils/caching/advancedCache.ts - LRU cache with stale-while-revalidate
// components/PerformanceDashboard/ - Real-time performance monitoring
```

#### **Service Worker & Offline:**
```javascript
// public/sw.js - Advanced caching strategies
// app/offline/page.tsx - Offline fallback page
```

## üö® **Critical Notes**

1. **Don't Repeat Git Mistakes:**
   - Commit frequently during recovery
   - Test each major restoration step
   - Keep stashes until everything is verified working

2. **Priority Order:**
   1. Core functionality (API routes, basic optimizations)
   2. Testing infrastructure
   3. Performance monitoring
   4. Advanced features

3. **Validation Steps:**
   - `npm run build` should succeed
   - `npm run test:run` should pass core tests
   - `npm run dev` should start without errors
   - Lighthouse should show improved performance

## üìÇ **Critical File Locations & Configurations**

### **Known Working Configurations from Stash:**

#### **Next.js Config** (`next.config.mjs`)
```javascript
// Key optimizations that were working:
- withBundleAnalyzer integration
- Image optimization (WebP/AVIF, device sizes)
- Compression enabled
- Package import optimization for Tiptap
- Console removal in production
- PoweredBy header removal
```

#### **Package Dependencies** (`package.json`)
```json
// Critical additions that were working:
"scripts": {
  "analyze": "ANALYZE=true npm run build",
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:run": "vitest run"
}

"devDependencies": {
  "@next/bundle-analyzer": "^15.4.5",
  "vitest": "^3.2.4",
  "@testing-library/*": "latest versions"
}
```

#### **TypeScript Route Handler Pattern** (Working)
```typescript
// All API routes should use this Next.js 15 pattern:
export async function GET(
  _request: Request,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }
) {
  const { slug } = await params;
  // ... rest of handler
}
```

### **Missing Infrastructure to Recreate:**

#### **Testing Setup**
- `vitest.config.ts` - Path aliases (`@` pointing to root)
- `test/setup.ts` - requestIdleCallback polyfill for @axe-core/react
- `test/test-utils.tsx` - React testing utilities wrapper

#### **Performance Monitoring**
- `utils/performance/monitor.ts` - Core Web Vitals tracking
- `utils/caching/advancedCache.ts` - LRU cache with stale-while-revalidate
- `components/PerformanceDashboard/` - Real-time performance UI

#### **Service Worker & Offline**
- `public/sw.js` - Advanced caching strategies
- `app/offline/page.tsx` - Offline fallback page with navigation
