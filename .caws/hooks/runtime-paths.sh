# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Shared runtime bootstrap for CAWS hook scripts.
# Ensures common developer-installed binaries remain available when hooks run
# under a reduced PATH that does not load interactive shell init.
#
# Growing this hook for your repo's runtime is welcome (that is the point — see
# the edit_stance header). What is NOT: patching PATH handling here as an
# unblock SHORTCUT when a hook failed. That weakens the guard instead of fixing
# the cause. Fix the real issue in the worktree/spec setup first; change the
# hook runtime deliberately, not to dodge a block.
