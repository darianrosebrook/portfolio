# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# CAWS Command Safety Gate (shared).
# Delegates to classify_command.py for robust command parsing and classification.
# Falls back to bash pattern matching if Python is unavailable.
#
# The Python classifier handles:
#   - Heredoc-aware parsing (won't false-positive on quoted dangerous commands)
#   - Quoted-region stripping (echo "git reset --hard" is safe)
#   - Pipeline-aware dangers (curl | sh)
#   - Context-aware rm classification (safe prefixes vs dangerous targets)
#   - Proper shell segmentation (&&, ||, ;, |)
