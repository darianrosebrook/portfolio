# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Shared guard-message legibility helpers (HOOK-GUARD-LEGIBILITY-001).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The caws-firsttime-probe run-003 proved every write/exec
# guard layer (scope-guard, worktree-write-guard, block-dangerous) is reachable
# and correct — yet a first-timer (the probing agent itself, three times)
# mis-attributed CAWS refusal prompts to the agent harness, because the
# REASON string did not say which guard fired or what to do about it. A correct
# guard that does not name itself reads as harness noise, and noise gets
# dismissed. This file centralizes two things every guard refusal should carry:
#
#   1. a STABLE, GREPPABLE identity prefix naming the guard, so the reader can
#      tell it is CAWS governance and WHICH guard — never a generic confirm
#      indistinguishable from a harness permission prompt; and
#   2. a literal, copy-pasteable REMEDIATION command where one exists.
#
# These helpers produce TEXT only. They do not decide, block, ask, or latch —
# the calling guard owns the decision and the envelope (see lib/emit.sh). This
# slice changes message text, never enforcement.
#
# Functions:
#   guard_identity <guard-name>
#       Echo the stable identity token for a guard, e.g.
#       "CAWS scope-guard". Callers prepend this to a reason so the FIRST
#       thing the reader sees names the mechanism. <guard-name> is a short
#       slug: scope-guard | worktree-write-guard | command-safety.
#
#   guard_amend_scope_hint <spec-id> <path>
#       Echo the literal widening command a reader can copy-paste to bring
#       <path> into the bound spec's scope.in. When <spec-id> is empty/unknown,
#       emits a clearly-placeholdered form so the reader still knows the shape.
#
#   guard_not_harness_note
#       Echo a one-line disambiguation reminding the reader this is CAWS
#       governance, not an agent-harness permission prompt.

# Guard against double-sourcing.

# guard_identity <guard-name>

# guard_not_harness_note
#   One-line disambiguation. Run-003's core finding: the agent could not tell a

#   specific to the agent harness the user is working in.
