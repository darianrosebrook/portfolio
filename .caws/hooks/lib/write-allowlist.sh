#
# CAWS Write Allowlist (shared lib).
# CAWS-GUARD-ALLOWLIST-SYNC-001.
#
# ONE source of truth for the unconditional-allow path set. Both
# worktree-write-guard.sh (Write/Edit arm) and bash-write-guard.sh (Bash
# mutation arm) call caws_is_write_allowlisted so the two guards return the
# SAME allow verdict for the SAME path — they cannot diverge by tool.
#
# Doctrine: docs/failure-lineage.md:888 lists the must-permit governance
# allowlist paths (.caws/specs/*, .caws/worktrees.json, .caws/policy.yaml,
# instruction files, docs/). The allowlist encodes that posture so a
# canonical-checkout coordination edit is not blocked regardless of which
# tool the agent reaches for.
#
# CRITICAL: this helper handles ONLY unconditional-allow paths. The
# .caws/worktrees/<name>/<rest> payload path is OWNERSHIP-CHECKED (routed
# through worktree-claim-oracle.cjs) and is deliberately EXCLUDED from this
# allowlist. If a path is on this allowlist, it is allowed with no further
# adjudication; if it is not, the caller still runs its oracle/claim logic.
#
# NOTE on bash case patterns and shell variables:
#   bash case patterns CANNOT expand shell variables, so the agent-state
#   home dir ("${HOME:-}/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/") and the vendor hooks dir
#   ("$PROJECT_DIR/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/") and CAWS_INSTRUCTION_FILES arms
#   are matched via [[ == ]] conditionals, not case patterns. Any future
#   allowlist arm that needs a variable must follow the same pattern.
#
# Requires (sourced by caller BEFORE calling the function):
#   - CAWS_VENDOR_DIR        (from lib/agent-surface.sh)
#   - CAWS_INSTRUCTION_FILES (from lib/agent-surface.sh; optional — empty ok)
#   - HOME                   (env; falls back to empty)
# Caller passes PROJECT_DIR as $2 (falls back to CAWS_PROJECT_DIR or '.').

# caws_is_write_allowlisted <abs_path> [<project_dir>]
#   Returns 0 if <abs_path> is on the unconditional-allow list.
#   Returns 1 otherwise (caller proceeds to oracle/claim adjudication).
#   Never calls exit — the caller decides what an allow means in its context.
