# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting the re-wrap contract to dodge a block instead of fixing the
#   cause. Grow everything else freely.
# Agent-PID session correlation — the harness-agnostic core.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (CAWS-AGENT-PID-SESSION-CORRELATION-001). ZCode and other
# harnesses export NO session-id env var to their tool subprocesses, so the
# shell resolver (lib/session-id.sh) and the TS resolver (resolve-session.ts)
# fall past their env tiers to a durable-envelope scan that is ambiguous at
# the canonical checkout (N sessions, one repoRoot). The agent process,
# however, is a stable, per-session-unique ANCESTOR of both the hook
# subprocess and the agent's own Bash/caws commands — reachable by walking the
# PID tree. That PID is a correlation key that crosses the tool boundary
# without an env var.
#
# The mechanism mirrors the durable-envelope bridge: the hook writes a record
# keyed by agent PID (parse-input.sh's _write_agent_pid_record), and the
# resolvers read their OWN agent PID and look it up. Persists in
# .caws/sessions/ the same way session logs and envelopes do.
#
# HARNESS-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION. This lib knows NOTHING about process
# names or harness identity. resolve_agent_pid takes the match set as an
# argument (CAWS_AGENT_PROCESS_NAMES, set per-surface by agent-surface.sh —
# the single adapter). A new harness works the moment its adapter names its
# agent ancestor; this core is unchanged.
#
# FAIL-OPEN. Every path returns empty (no identity) on any miss — missing
# record, unfound ancestor, or PID-reuse start-time mismatch — so callers
# fall through to the existing env→envelope→capsule chain. No new refusal
# modes. (A record's age is NOT a miss condition: validity is liveness + the
# start-time match, not time-since-last-fire.)
#
# IDEMPOTENT: safe to source multiple times.

# read_session_id_from_agent_pid — the read-side of the correlation. Resolves

# process at <pid> still has a start time matching the record's started_at).

# Unlike the durable-envelope tier, this record is keyed to a SPECIFIC LIVE
# PROCESS — resolve_agent_pid just walked to it from $$, so it is alive by
# construction. Validity is established by liveness (the walk) + the start-time
# match (guards against PID reuse), NOT by time-since-last-fire. A record
# written days ago for a process that is still running (same start time) is
# authoritative regardless of age. This is what lets a session leave its
# worktree and return after any gap: the agent process is unchanged, so the
# record is valid. last_seen_at is still WRITTEN (refresh hygiene + future
# cleanup heuristics) but is NOT consulted on the read path.
