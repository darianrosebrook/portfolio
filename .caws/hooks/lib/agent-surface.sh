# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Surface resolver — derives harness-specific values from CAWS_AGENT_SURFACE.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The shared core must not branch on a hardcoded harness name
# or read a harness-specific env var directly (architecture invariant from
# docs/architecture/hook-pack-shared-core.md §"Dependency-injection environment
# contract"). All harness specifics reach shared scripts through an injected
# environment set by the vendor wiring at hook-invocation time.
#
# This file is the single point that maps the injected CAWS_AGENT_SURFACE into
# the derived values every shared hook needs:
#
#   CAWS_VENDOR_DIR     — the harness's dot-directory name (e.g. ".claude",
#                         ".codex"). No trailing slash.
#   CAWS_LOG_DIR        — absolute path to the harness's log directory
#                         ($CAWS_PROJECT_DIR/<vendor>/logs). Requires
#                         CAWS_PROJECT_DIR to be non-empty; otherwise empty.
#   CAWS_PLATFORM_FLAG  — the value to pass as --platform to any CAWS CLI
#                         invocations that accept it (e.g. "claude-code",
#                         "codex").
#   CAWS_PERMISSION_VOCAB — "ask" when the harness supports a PreToolUse "ask"
#                         decision (Claude Code), "deny" when it does not
#                         (Codex maps ask->deny). Used by emit.sh to select
#                         the correct permission-decision vocabulary.
#   CAWS_SUPPORTS_UPDATED_INPUT — "1" when the harness honors the PreToolUse
#                         updatedInput contract (quiet-merge.sh rewrites the
#                         command), "0" when it does not (kimi-code: no
#                         documented updatedInput contract; qwen-code:
#                         documented but not enforced in 0.21.x — quiet-merge
#                         passes the command through unrewritten).
#   CAWS_INSTRUCTION_FILES — space-separated root instruction filenames the
#                         harness reads at the repo root (e.g. "CLAUDE.md" for
#                         claude-code, "AGENTS.md" for codex/opencode/zcode).
#                         Used by worktree-write-guard.sh's allowlist so a
#                         session editing its harness's doctrine file does not
#                         trip the base-branch write guard. The unknown-surface
#                         fallback lists BOTH common files (fail-safe for
#                         multi-surface repos).
#
# PROJECT ROOT RESOLUTION (back-compat fallback chain):
#   CAWS_PROJECT_DIR is the canonical env var injected by the vendor wiring.
#   If it is not set (not-yet-migrated wiring), this resolver falls back to:
#     1. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR  (legacy Claude Code wiring)
#     2. CODEX_PROJECT_DIR   (legacy Codex wiring)
#     3. .  (cwd — last resort)
#   The resolved value is re-exported as CAWS_PROJECT_DIR so all downstream
#   scripts can use the single canonical name.
#
#   HOOK-PROJECT-DIR-ROOT-NOT-CWD-01: a vendor *_PROJECT_DIR may be the
#   session's CWD rather than the repo root (zcode sets CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to
#   the session cwd, which is often a package-bearing subdirectory). A
#   subdirectory value would fragment every CAWS_PROJECT_DIR-derived path
#   (CAWS_LOG_DIR, the heartbeat lease cache, the audit log) into a stray
#   <subdir>/.caws or <subdir>/.zcode. So each candidate is NORMALIZED to its
#   git repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before adoption — the
#   same invariant the codex dispatcher already binds (hook-install.ts
#   codexCommand: CAWS_PROJECT_DIR=$REPO_ROOT). This is a no-op when the
#   candidate is already the root (Claude Code, Codex). On git-absent or
#   not-a-repo, the raw candidate is kept (fail-open — never downgrade a real
#   vendor signal to "."); the bare "." fallback is reached ONLY when no
#   vendor *_PROJECT_DIR is set at all.
#
# SURFACES:
#   claude-code  — Claude Code (Anthropic CLI). Default when CAWS_AGENT_SURFACE
#                  is unset, preserving back-compat for any existing wiring that
#                  does not yet inject the surface identity.
#   codex        — OpenAI Codex CLI.
#   zcode        — ZCode CLI. Strict-JSON hook output contract; the vendor
#                  wiring installs a bridge wrapper (caws-bridge.sh) that
#                  re-wraps non-JSON shared-dispatcher output as valid
#                  additionalContext envelopes. Supports PreToolUse ask.
#   kimi-code    — Kimi Code CLI. Hooks live ONLY in the user-level
#                  $KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml (no project-level config), so
#                  the wiring is a repo-conditional shim (caws-kimi-hook.sh)
#                  that resolves the git root at invocation time (codex
#                  precedent) and no-ops outside CAWS repos. Deny-only PreToolUse
#                  vocab (verified live: "ask" does not block); block reasons
#                  go to stderr with exit 2.
#   qwen-code    — Qwen Code CLI. Hooks live in the repo-local
#                  .qwen/settings.json, but Qwen exports no env var that
#                  reliably names the repo root (QWEN_CODE_PROJECT_DIR is the
#                  per-project state dir under ~/.qwen/projects/<slug>, probed
#                  live on 0.21.4), so the wiring is a repo-conditional shim
#                  (caws-qwen-hook.sh) that resolves the git root at
#                  invocation time (codex/kimi precedent) and no-ops outside
#                  CAWS repos. Full allow/deny/ask PreToolUse vocab (ask
#                  prompts interactively and degrades to deny in
#                  headless/background); updatedInput is documented but NOT
#                  enforced in 0.21.x, so quiet-merge passes the command
#                  through unrewritten.
#   (future)     — cursor, windsurf, vscode, idea, ... Add a case arm below.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: safe to source multiple times.
#
# FAIL-OPEN: unknown surface falls through to the claude-code defaults so a
# misconfigured wiring does not become a hard block.
