# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Session-scoped guard reprieve consult (CAWS-GUARD-REPRIEVE-SESSION-SCOPED-001).
#
# A reprieve is a governed, per-session, expiring, machine-checkable way to SKIP a
# PreToolUse guard for exactly one agent session. It replaces the anti-pattern of
# commenting a guard out of the dispatcher's HANDLERS array (which disables it for
# EVERY agent, forever, with no reason/approver/expiry).
#
# Record (written by `caws reprieve grant`, read here):
#   ${CAWS_PROJECT_DIR}/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/hooks/state/guard-reprieve-<sanitized-session>.json
#   {
#     "session_id": "...", "created_at": "...", "expires_at": "...",
#     "approved_by": "...", "reason": "...", "handlers": ["protected-paths.sh", ...]
#   }
#
# This lib mirrors the danger-latch substrate (block-dangerous.sh:73-103):
#   - same state dir (hooks/state/), same sanitize_session transform, same
#     per-session keying, same gitignored-operational-cache posture.
#   - the writer (caws reprieve grant) and this reader both route through
#     resolve_caws_session_id + sanitize_session so the same session id resolves
#     to the same filename in every context (the DANGER-LATCH-UX-001 lesson).
#
# The one addition over the latch model: an `expires_at` field. An expired
# reprieve is treated as ABSENT (derived on read, never mutated).
#
# IDEMPOTENT: safe to source multiple times.

# reprieve granted in one context is honored in every worktree of the same
# repo. CAWS-GUARD-REPRIEVE-LOCATION-COUPLING-001: without this, an agent that
# grants from the canonical checkout then enters a worktree finds the
# dispatcher's CAWS_PROJECT_DIR points at the worktree, the reprieve file is
# absent there, and the guard re-blocks — defeating the feature in the exact
# multi-worktree workflow CAWS is for. Same lesson guard-strikes.sh applies
# (it moves strike state OUT of the worktree entirely). Resolution:
#   1. git rev-parse --git-common-dir → <canonical>/.git; parent = canonical root
#   2. fall back to CAWS_PROJECT_DIR when not in a linked worktree or git fails
# Creates the dir if missing (mkdir -p is idempotent; a read consult that has to
# create the dir is harmless — the file simply won't exist in it).
