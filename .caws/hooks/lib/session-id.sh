# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Session-id resolver — the SHELL-SIDE single source of truth for "what is the
# current session id?" across every hook that needs to compare against a
# worktree owner.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (CAWS-SESSION-RESOLVER-GUARD-DIVERGENCE-001). Before this lib,
# three shell surfaces each re-implemented their own session-id precedence, and a
# fourth (the write guards) passed ONLY HOOK_SESSION_ID to the ownership oracle.
# The TS resolver (resolve-session.ts) used yet another, broader chain. The four
# chains disagreed, so the surface that STAMPED an owner (worktree create, via the
# resolver) and the surface that CHECKED an owner (the guards, via the oracle)
# read different sources — and whenever they disagreed the rightful owner was
# treated as foreign (false block_foreign_worktree), or, worse, a foreign session
# could be treated as owner-self. This lib is the shell half of the fix: ONE
# env-var precedence every shell surface consults, mirroring the resolver's chain.
#
# THE CANONICAL PRECEDENCE (env vars only; shell cannot scan disk):
#   1. CLAUDE_SESSION_ID     — operator override (deliberate; always wins)
#   2. CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID — Claude Code harness UUID; survives the agent-Bash
#                               tool boundary (HOOK_SESSION_ID does not)
#   3. CODEX_THREAD_ID        — Codex harness per-thread id; survives the tool
#                               boundary. THE fix for the codex incident: codex
#                               exports this, not CLAUDE_*_SESSION_ID.
#   4. QWEN_CODE_SESSION_ID   — Qwen Code harness session UUID (probed live on
#                               0.21.4); survives the tool boundary.
#   5. CAWS_SESSION_ID        — generic CAWS escape hatch (any harness)
#   6. HOOK_SESSION_ID        — the hook-envelope id (set only inside the hook's
#                               own shell; does NOT propagate to agent-Bash)
#   7. CURSOR_TRACE_ID        — cursor low-stability fallback
#   → "unknown" sentinel when nothing is set (the resolver refuses this literal).
#
# This MUST stay in lockstep with resolve-session.ts's env-var tiers
# (claude_env → claude_code_env → codex_thread_env → qwen_env → caws_env →
# hook_env → cursor_env). If you add a source to one, add it to the other.
#
# SURFACE DISPATCH. Each harness exports a DIFFERENT per-session id under a
# DIFFERENT env var. Rather than branch on a hardcoded harness name (architecture
# invariant: the shared core must not), this chain simply consults every known
# per-surface var in priority order. The first non-empty, non-"unknown" value
# wins — and because each harness only sets its OWN var, there is no collision
# across concurrent surfaces in the same shell.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: safe to source multiple times.

# resolve_caws_session_id — print the current session id per the canonical

#
# Precedence (mirrors the TS resolver resolve-session.ts so shell + TS agree on
# identity by construction — CAWS-SESSION-SHELL-RESOLVER-CAPSULE-001):

#      agent-Bash case where no identity env var survives the subshell). Without
#      it, the resolver returned "unknown" and the write-guards treated the
#      owner's own edits as foreign. This is completing the shell resolver to
#      match the canonical identity model, NOT a parallel fallback.
# Returns "unknown" only when no capsule exists (fresh repo, no mint yet).
