#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force

#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the

Usage: reset-danger-latch.sh (--current | --all | --session <id>) --reason "<why this is safe>"

Clears the dangerous-command latch(es) written by block-dangerous.sh so that
Bash tool calls may resume. A reason is mandatory and is recorded to the
audit log at:
  $LOG_FILE

Modes (exactly one required):
  --current            Clear the latch for the current session
                       (resolved from CAWS_SESSION_ID / CLAUDE_SESSION_ID / HOOK_SESSION_ID).
  --all                Clear every latch in this project.
  --session <id>       Clear the latch for a specific session id.

Required:
  --reason "<text>"    Human-supplied justification, recorded to the log.
