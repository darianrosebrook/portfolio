# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.

# Plan Transcript Finalize — drains the pending-plan-snapshots list and
# overwrites each snapshot with the FINAL turn-end transcript (which includes
# user approval, any subsequent reasoning, and the rest of the turn).
#
# Wired into: Stop (and optionally PreCompact).
#
# Companion: plan-transcript-snapshot.sh (PostToolUse/ExitPlanMode) builds
# the pending list.
# Promoted from Sterling per CAWS-HOOK-PACK-PROMOTE-001.
