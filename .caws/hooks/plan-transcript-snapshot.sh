# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.

# Plan Transcript Snapshot — capture conversation context at the moment
# the agent presents a plan via ExitPlanMode.
#
# Wired into: PostToolUse with matcher "ExitPlanMode" (self-filters on
# $HOOK_TOOL_NAME at the top).
#
# Output:
#   - <plan-path>.transcript.jsonl  — co-located transcript snapshot.
#   - $HOME/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/.pending-plan-snapshots — newline-separated
#     list of snapshot paths awaiting Stop-hook finalization.
#
# FLAG (session-log.sh companion): the transcript discovery path
# $HOME/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/projects/ is harness-specific for claude-code.
# For other surfaces the pending file path is sufficient; the resolver in
# session-log.sh handles transcript lookup surface-specifically.
#
# Companion: plan-transcript-finalize.sh (Stop hook) drains the pending
# list and finalizes each snapshot with the turn-end transcript.
# Promoted from Sterling per CAWS-HOOK-PACK-PROMOTE-001.
