# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
#
# Quiet merge hook: suppress verbose output AND fix CWD safety
#
# Two problems solved:
# 1. `caws worktree merge` produces verbose output that can overflow context.
# 2. When a subagent's CWD is inside the worktree being destroyed, the process
#    loses its CWD and crashes (posix_spawn ENOENT on PostToolUse hooks).
#
# The fix: rewrite merge/destroy commands to:
#   cd <repo-root> && <command> 2>/dev/null | tail -3
# This moves CWD to safety BEFORE the directory is destroyed, and suppresses
# verbose output.
#
# IMPORTANT: This hook MUST be the last PreToolUse hook for Bash commands
# that intercepts input. It emits updatedInput which replaces any prior
# hook's updatedInput. Order in dispatch/pre_tool_use.sh: after the
# blocking guards (so a real refusal still fires), before scan-secrets
# (which is advisory-only and emits additionalContext, not updatedInput).
#
# Promoted from Sterling per CAWS-HOOK-PACK-PROMOTE-001 and
# docs/reports/sterling_hook_port_audit_001.md. Companion to cwd-guard.sh
# (entry 22) for the worktree-destroyed-while-inside class.
