# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
#
# CAWS God-Object Check
#
# Advisory: flags a written/edited file whose SLOC exceeds CAWS_GOD_OBJECT_LOC
# (default 2000). Edit-time analogue of the `god_object` gate. Always exit 0.
#
# HYSTERESIS (CAWS-GOD-OBJECT-CHECK-HYSTERESIS-001): the advisory fires only
# when an edit is itself SIGNAL, not on every edit to an already-over file. A
# 2-line edit that leaves a 2004-line file at 2006 is noise; re-warning on it
# trains the agent to ignore the advisory. So for an Edit, the hook warns only
# when EITHER (a) this edit CROSSES the threshold (the file was at-or-under it
# before this edit, and is over it after), OR (b) this edit adds a LARGE delta
# (>= CAWS_GOD_OBJECT_DELTA SLOC, default 100). An Edit that leaves an already-
# over file roughly the same size — or shrinks it — is silent. A Write of a
# whole file IS its own delta, so a Write warns whenever the result is over
# threshold (unchanged). The prior size is derived from the Edit payload
# (old_string/new_string), keeping the hook STATELESS — no on-disk sentinel —
# consistent with loc-delta-check.sh. Always exit 0.
