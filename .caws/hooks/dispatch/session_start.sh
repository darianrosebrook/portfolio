# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# SessionStart dispatcher — shared core (surface-neutral).
#
# Fires once per session. Same fan-out semantics as pre_tool_use.sh and
# post_tool_use.sh: reads stdin once, exports HOOK_* env vars, invokes
# each registered handler with stdin piped and stderr prefixed.
#
# HANDLERS entries may carry a positional argument (e.g. "audit.sh
# session-start" — audit.sh's event type is an argv, not a field in
# the stdin payload). Entries are split on whitespace and passed as argv.
#
# SessionStart semantics: these hooks inform the agent about session
# state (CAWS briefing, audit log bootstrap, session-log meta file).
# None should block. Exit 2 is treated the same as exit 1 here —
# recorded as max_exit but does not short-circuit.
