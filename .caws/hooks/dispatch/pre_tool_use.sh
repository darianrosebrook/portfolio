# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
#
# PreToolUse dispatcher — shared core (surface-neutral).
#
# Single entry point invoked from the vendor wiring's PreToolUse block. Reads
# stdin ONCE, sanitizes it via lib/parse-input.sh, then invokes every
# registered handler with HOOK_* env vars inherited and the sanitized
# JSON piped to each handler's stdin.
#
# The vendor wiring injects the surface identity before invoking this script:
#   CAWS_AGENT_SURFACE=<surface>  (e.g. claude-code | codex)
#   CAWS_PROJECT_DIR=<repo-root>  (replaces harness-specific PROJECT_DIR vars)
#
# lib/agent-surface.sh is sourced first to derive all surface-specific values
# (CAWS_VENDOR_DIR, CAWS_LOG_DIR, CAWS_PLATFORM_FLAG) from CAWS_AGENT_SURFACE.
# Individual handlers read those exported vars rather than branching on the
# surface name themselves.
#
# Handlers self-filter via their own matcher predicate (a case statement on
# $HOOK_TOOL_NAME at the top of the script).
#
# Exit-code aggregation:
#   - First handler exiting 2 short-circuits the remaining handlers and
#     the dispatcher returns 2 (blocking).
#   - Non-zero non-2 exits are warnings; the dispatcher continues and
#     returns the max non-2 code at the end.
#
# Fail posture (two distinct cases — CAWS-HOOK-SOURCE-GUARD-FAIL-SOFT-001):
#   - A TRANSIENT error after the core libs load (a malformed payload that
#     parse_hook_input rejects) fails OPEN — exit 0 — so a guard hiccup never
#     blocks a legitimate tool call.
#   - A MISSING CORE LIB (agent-surface.sh / parse-input.sh / run-handlers.sh
#     absent) is NOT a transient bug: it means EVERY guard is disabled — the
#     danger latch, scope guard, and write guards never run. Silently exiting 0
#     there is the governance hole that disarmed enforcement in a consumer repo
#     whose agent-surface.sh was never vendored. That case fails LOUD + SAFE:
#     a self-identifying diagnostic to stderr and a block decision, so a broken
#     hook install surfaces as a recoverable refusal ("run caws init --adopt")
#     instead of silent, total loss of enforcement.
