# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# PostToolUse dispatcher — shared core (surface-neutral).
#
# Single entry point invoked from the vendor wiring's PostToolUse block. Reads
# stdin ONCE, sanitizes via lib/parse-input.sh, then invokes every registered
# handler with HOOK_* env vars inherited and the sanitized JSON piped to each
# handler's stdin.
#
# Differences from pre_tool_use.sh:
#   - HANDLERS entries may carry a positional argument (e.g. "audit.sh
#     tool-use"). Entries are split on whitespace and passed to the
#     handler as argv, so existing scripts that dispatch on $1 keep
#     working without change.
#   - Exit 2 is a no-op for PostToolUse semantically (the tool has
#     already run) but we still honor it to short-circuit the chain and
#     propagate the blocker's stderr, matching the pre-tool-use contract.
#
# Stdout: last non-empty handler buffer wins. Most PostToolUse handlers
# write hookSpecificOutput JSON (quality-check, validate-spec, naming,
# doc-frontmatter). Since each of those self-filters on file type, only
# one of them emits stdout for any given Write/Edit. If two ever collide
# (e.g., a YAML file that happens to match both the spec validator and
# the naming check), the later-in-HANDLERS wins. Order below is set so
# the more informative check runs last.
#
# Stderr: prefixed with "[<handler>]" so the source of any message is
# visible to the agent.
#
# Fail-open: parser or lib failure returns exit 0 silently.
#
# Per-surface HANDLERS note: certain surfaces disable specific handlers. The
# current HANDLERS list reflects the claude-code defaults. A codex adapter
# would omit quality-check.sh (disabled on codex). When per-surface override
# lists are implemented, this file will be the base and the surface adapter
# will carry only its delta.
