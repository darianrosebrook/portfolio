# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.

# CAWS Bash Write-Target Guard (shared, WORKTREE-ISOLATION-HARDENING-001 Fix 3).
# Self-filters on Bash, extracts write targets for a narrow set of mutation
# forms, routes each through lib/worktree-claim-oracle.cjs — same oracle as
# worktree-write-guard.sh so a Bash mutation and a Write/Edit get the same
# owner-vs-session answer.
#
# Recognized mutation forms:
#   redirection      > FILE   >> FILE
#   tee              tee FILE   tee -a FILE
#   in-place editors sed -i ... FILE   perl -pi ... FILE
#   truncate/touch   truncate ... FILE   touch FILE
#   remove/move/copy rm FILE   mv SRC DST   cp SRC DST   dd of=FILE
#   git path-restore git restore FILE   git checkout -- FILE
#                    git reset -- FILE   git clean
