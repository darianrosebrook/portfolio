# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.

# CAWS Worktree Write Guard (shared).
#
# Two responsibilities:
#
#   1. Canonical-spec-materialization refusal
#      (WORKTREE-SPEC-CANONICAL-ACCESS-GUARD-001 A1/A2).
#      From inside a linked worktree, refuse Read/Write/Edit tool calls
#      whose file_path resolves under <linked-worktree>/.caws/specs/*.
#
#   2. Base-branch write enforcement (fail-open for v11.1; uses the
#      worktrees registry and ownership oracle for .caws/worktrees/* payload).
#
# NOTE on CAWS_VENDOR_DIR allowlist arm:
#   The always-allowed arm for the agent-state directory uses
#   "${HOME:-}/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/" (e.g. ~/.claude/ for claude-code).
#   bash case patterns CANNOT expand shell variables, so this arm is
#   written as a conditional expression using [[ == ]] with CAWS_VENDOR_DIR.
