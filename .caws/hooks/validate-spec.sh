# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# CAWS Spec Validation Hook
# Validates a .caws/specs/*.yaml file when it's edited. OPT-IN: not wired into
# the default post_tool_use HANDLERS array.
#
# CAWS-SPECS-VALIDATE-FILE-CMD-001 (Half B): validation is delegated to the
# canonical `caws specs validate <file>` command (parse->shape->semantics via
# the kernel, using the CLI's OWN bundled js-yaml). The hook no longer embeds a
# `node -e require('js-yaml')` block — that assumed the consumer is a Node
# project with js-yaml resolvable from the hook's exec context, which is false
# for non-Node consumers (Sterling etc.) and caused the
# CAWS-VALIDATE-SPEC-JSYAML-CONFLATION-001 "YAML syntax error: Cannot find
# module 'js-yaml'" misreport on every spec edit. Validation now lives in CAWS
# tooling, language-agnostically. The prior V2 `test_nodeids` advisory block was
# also dropped: it read v10 `status`/`acceptance_criteria` fields (v11 is
# `lifecycle_state`/`acceptance`), so it never fired on a v11 spec, and it
# depended on the same embedded js-yaml.
