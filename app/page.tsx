            As a seasoned Product Designer with a strong background in UX
            engineering, I specialize in crafting robust design systems and
            developing custom design tooling for Figma that revolutionizes
            product development workflows. Based in Portland, Oregon, I thrive
            at the intersection of design and development, where I dedicate my
            efforts to streamlining collaboration and optimizing product
            development cycles.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a unique blend of design and development expertise, I excel at
            bridging the gap between design and engineering teams, enhancing the
            user experience for both when interacting with design systems. By
            creating custom tooling that integrates Figma with GitHub, I enable
            seamless workflows that drive innovation and foster a collaborative
            environment, ultimately accelerating the delivery of exceptional
            designs to customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have successfully led cross-functional teams
            through highly technical projects, collaborating with project
            managers and development leads to break down complex initiatives
            into manageable arcs of work. By effectively managing and delegating
            resources, I ensure the smooth execution of projects, delivering
            results that exceed expectations.
          </p>

            can collaborate to create innovative solutions, feel free to reach
            out! I&apos;m always eager to connect with like-minded professionals
            and explore new opportunities in UX and Product Design.
